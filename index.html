	I am in my third year of the combined degree program studying Art and Engineering Psychology. 
	<br/> <br/>
	My IP address is 10.245.58.132.
	<br/> <br/>
	I was born in Cary, North Carolina, but I've lived near Philadelphia for most of my life.
	<br/> <br/>
	I have six siblings. I'm not sure if this is unexpected necessariy, but it's unusual at least.
	<br/> <br/>
	Here is a picture of a pumpkin that I crocheted. I think it's pretty cute.
